hoc2

Example of using FlexModule and BisonModule to create Python modules
using Flex and Bison.

This example is loosely based on the second version of hoc in _The
UNIX Programming Environment_ by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike.  It
implements something like a four function command line calculator with
one character variables.

The interesting bits are:

hocgrammar.y: The Bison grammar
hoclexer.l:   The Flex lexical analyzer
hoc:          The Python code to implement the calculator

To build it, run

  make -f Makefile.pre.in boot
  make hocgrammar.c
  make

To run it, build (I mean, do)

  python hoc hocinput

For more information on Flexmodule.h, BisonModule.h, Symbols.py, or
the other files in this example directory, look for FlexModule and
